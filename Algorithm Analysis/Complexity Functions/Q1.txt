Algorithm
What is the total no of times the inner loop(j) instruction set is executed in the given algorithm?

Note: 'Break' instruction is removed, and rest of the code remains same.

 

    public void findDuplicates(int[] id) {
        System.out.println("Duplicate student id : ");
        for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i +1; j < id.length; j++) {
                if (id[i] == id[j])
                    System.out.print(id[i] + " ");
            }
        }
    }


n(nâˆ’1)/2
The break instruction is executed when there is duplicate data. On removing the instruction, the inner loop iterates through each data cell till the value of j equals the length of the array, irrespective of the input data. So in total, this algorithm takes n(n-1)/2steps. This is the worst case of algorithm 1, when there are no duplicate student IDs in the given data.
